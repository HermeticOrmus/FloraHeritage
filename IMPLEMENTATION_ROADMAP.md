# Casa Flora Botanical Bedroom Naming - Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step implementation of the botanical bedroom naming system for Casa Flora's 5 bedrooms, transforming generic room numbers into a living heritage experience that connects guests to Boquete's flower culture and four generations of family stewardship.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Goal**: Establish core naming infrastructure with minimal investment

### Priority Actions

#### 1.1 Room Name Confirmation & Photography
- [ ] **Validate actual room features** against assumptions
  - Downstairs Room 1: Beds, views, bathroom fixtures
  - Downstairs Room 2: Beds, views, bathroom fixtures
  - Upstairs Room 1: Configuration, window views
  - Upstairs Room 2: Configuration, window views
  - Upstairs Room 3: Configuration, window views
  - Shared upstairs bathroom: Location, access

- [ ] **Photograph each room** in current state
  - Wide angle showing full space
  - Detail shots of windows, views, special features
  - Document which flowers are visible from each room

- [ ] **Garden flower inventory**
  - Photograph all flowers mentioned in naming system
  - Document location of: Coffee plants, Hydrangeas, Bougainvillea, Impatiens/Begonias, Orchids (if any)
  - Note seasonal blooming periods

#### 1.2 Name Assignment Decision

**Final Names (APPROVED):**

**Downstairs (Premium - En-Suite Bathrooms):**
1. ✅ **Geisha** - World-famous Boquete coffee heritage
2. ✅ **Orquídea** - Panama's national flower (Spanish for elegance)

**Upstairs (Shared Bathroom Suite):**
3. ✅ **Hortensia** - Spanish for Hydrangea (romantic, musical)
4. ✅ **Veranera** - Spanish for Bougainvillea (simpler, evokes summer)
5. ✅ **Begonia** - Simple, sweet, perfect in both languages

jasmine-scented blossoms perfume the valley each October-November.

Visit in late autumn to experience their fragrant white blooms.

Coffee has been part of Boquete's heritage since the 19th century,

May your rest be as exceptional as the coffee that made Boquete famous.
```

Welcome to Orquídea

YOUR ROOM'S STORY:
Orquídea honors Panama's national flower—the exquisite "Holy Ghost
Orchid" (Peristeria elata). Orchids flourish in Boquete's cloud forests
and are the crown jewel of our annual Flower Fair each January.
